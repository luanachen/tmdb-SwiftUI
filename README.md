# tmdb-SwiftUI
A swiftUI and combine sample project with tmdbs data base

I'm testing new stuffs from SwiftUI, Combine, Swift Package Manager and Snapshot testing in this repository, feel free to check it out. :)

This project is divided in 3 packages (Commons, Login and Shows) aiming modularity and scalability.
The package Commons contains all the helpers and network wrappers used by other feature packages.
All the feature flows are handled by coordinators and their delegates.

This repository contains the main app (MoviesDB) and the demo apps for each feature.
